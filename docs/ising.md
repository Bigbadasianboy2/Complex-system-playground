# Ising Model (1D/2D)

**Idea (in one breath):** A grid of spins that like to match their neighbors; temperature decides whether the system orders or stays messy.

**What to look for**
- At low temperature: big uniform domains (magnetized).
- Near the critical region: large, lively fluctuations.
- At high temperature: disorder.

**Result (example)**

See: `examples/ising_2D_different_H.ipynb` for a short notebook and how to plot magnetization vs temperature following metropolis-hastings algorithm.
