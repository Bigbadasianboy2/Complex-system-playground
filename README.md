# Complex Systems Playground

Reproductions of classic models in statistical physics & sociophysics:
- **Ising (1D/2D)** — order ↔ disorder, magnetization, snapshots.
- **Axelrod** — cultural domains, consensus vs fragmentation.
- **NaSch** — traffic flow (coming soon).

**Website:** see the .md files in `docs/` for more detailed instructions.

**Examples:** open `examples/` notebooks and `models/` scripts to reproduce the plots.
