Reproductions of classic models in statistical physics & sociophysics:
- **Ising (1D/2D)** — order ↔ disorder, magnetization, snapshots.
- **Axelrod** — cultural domains, consensus vs fragmentation.
- **NaSch** — traffic flow (coming soon).

**Website:** see the gallery and notes on GitHub Pages.

**Examples:** open `examples/` notebooks to reproduce the plots.
